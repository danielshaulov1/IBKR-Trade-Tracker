   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project.

     - Gmail API
     - Google Sheets API

2. **🔐 How to generate `client_secret.json`**
   1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
   3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   4. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.

## 📁 Google Sheets Structure

Use the ready-to-use Google Sheets template to track your trades:

🔗 [Click here to open the sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LXaW6vJzmrlqaLyOZGVJnye97EwmJ92IkVHccgb5MV8/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make a copy: `File` → `Make a copy` to use it with your own account.
- Update the `SHEET_ID` in your `.env` file accordingly.
```python
SHEET_ID = 'your-spreadsheet-id-here'
```

---

## 🚀 Run the script

```bash
python main_script.py
```

It will:
- Load messages from Gmail (optionally filtered by label and date)
- Extract trade data from subject lines
- Append to the sheet only if not already present

---

## 📌 Optional: Use Gmail Label

If you organize your emails using a Gmail label (like `Interactive Brokers`), set it in your `.env` file :

```python
LABEL_NAME = 'Interactive Brokers'
```

If you want to **use all emails** (not labeled), set it to:

```python
LABEL_NAME = ''
# or
LABEL_NAME = 'ALL'
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit `token.json` or `client_secret.json` to GitHub.
- Add them to `.gitignore`:
```txt
token.json
client_secret.json
```

---

## ✅ Example Output

📩 Gmail returned 14 total messages
✅ New trade: TSLA BOUGHT 10.0 @ 123.45
✅ Wrote row to Transactions!A243:G243
